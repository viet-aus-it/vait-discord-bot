# Communication Style

## General Principles
- **Concise but friendly**: Informative with a collaborative tone
- **Code-focused**: Emphasize technical solutions over lengthy explanations
- **Structured language**: Use bullet points or short paragraphs
- **Practical**: Focus on what works for the community

## For Code/Technical Discussions
- Reference specific file paths with line numbers (`src/utils/logger.ts:45`)
- Cite Discord.js documentation when relevant
- Explain trade-offs clearly
- Suggest testable, atomic changes

## For Documentation
- Keep it concise and actionable
- Focus on "how" and "why"
- Use code examples where helpful
- Update README when adding new features

## For Issue Tracking
- Use GitHub issues for bugs and feature requests
- Follow issue templates
- Link related PRs and issues
- Be specific about reproduction steps

## Output Expectations

- **Structured responses**: Use bullet points, clear headings
- **Technical accuracy**: Reference discord.js v14 API, TypeScript best practices
- **Actionable advice**: Provide concrete next steps
- **Risk awareness**: Flag potential issues (rate limits, breaking changes)
- **Code examples**: Show working code snippets when helpful

## Formatting and Style Guidelines

- Use dashes for lists in markdown documents
- Use semicolons in TypeScript code
- Single quotes for strings unless interpolation needed
- Prefer template literals for multi-part strings
- Use trailing commas in objects and arrays (except function parameters)
