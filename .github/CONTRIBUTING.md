# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. So what does it
mean in details ?

### Report bugs and/or suggest idea for changes using Github's [issues](https://github.com/viet-aus-it/viet-aus-it.github.io/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy! Just follow the
Issue Template that we have created.

### Use GitHub's [Pull Requests](https://github.com/viet-aus-it/viet-aus-it.github.io/pulls) for implementation of said issues

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Clone the repo to your local machine
3. Follow the set up steps.
4. If you already followed the setup steps before, you only need to run `yarn install` to update dependencies.
5. If you've added new features, remember to add unit tests.
6. Ensure the code passes the linting tests (`yarn lint`) and all of the test suite passes. (`yarn test`)
7. Push your branch, and submit that pull request!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- You can try running `yarn format` for style unification
