# GIT development guideline
## Commandments:
### Branch
- Create a new branch for every task / small feature / bug fix from `master`
- Branch prefix:
  - Feature: `feature/`
  - Release: `release/`
  - Hotfix: `hotfix/`
  - Support: `support/`
- Branch name should refer to issue number: e.g `feature/#9_referral_link`
### Commit
- Make small/atomic commits.
- Do not commit vendor/compiled code.
- Do not commit commented-out code â€” just delete it.
- Explain the why, not the what, in your commit message:
  ```
  // Bad
  Updated index.js field
  // Good
  Remove debug statement from index.js
  ```
  - Keep in mind: [This](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) [has](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project#_commit_guidelines) [all](https://github.com/torvalds/subsurface-for-dirk/blob/master/README.md#contributing) [been](http://who-t.blogspot.co.at/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html) [said](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages) [before.](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/30bce7/CONTRIBUTING.md#format-commit-messages)
- Your commit message must also refer to issue number:
  ```
  #9 Remove debug statement from index.js
  ```
- Rebase instead of merge to resolve conflicts. However do not rebase or amend your branch/commit of your branch is already pull down by someone else
### PR / CHANGELOG
- Use pull requests. Get reviews.
- Do not commit or push directly to the master branch (you won't have permission to do this anyway)
- Before creating the PR, make sure you add a new entry to the [CHANGELOG.md](../README.md). Your changelog entry should also refer to the issue number
