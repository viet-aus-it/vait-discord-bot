## Requirements

- [Node 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- NPM 8+ (comes bundled with Node installation)
- Docker 20+, Docker Compose 1.28+
  - For macOS and Windows: The easiest way is to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop "docker desktop").
    This will come with Docker and Docker Compose in a bundle.
  - For Linux Users: You would need to:
    - Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server "docker engine")
    - Follow the [Linux post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/ "Linux post-installation steps").
    - Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ "docker compose")

## Onboarding

### Creating your discord app and bot

You will need to manually create a new discord application and a new bot. Please check out[this guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot) for more details

### Creating the config files

#### Using the onboarding script

On most UNIX-like systems (macOS, Linux and WSL), you should be able to run the
onboarding script. This script will create a local dev environment file, install
dependencies, build the docker containers and set up a pre-commit git hook.

```shell
./container_scripts/onboarding.sh
```

Please ensure that you have all the required programs/executable are
installed on your machine before running the script. If somehow the script
does not work for you, please let us know via the Issue tab or ping us on
Discord, and you might need to follow through the manual process.

#### Manually

After creating your discord app and bot, create config file and fill in the values you get from the previous step

```bash
cp .env.dist .env
cp config.dist.json config.json
```

- The `.env` file needs to be filled in with these values:
  - DB Values: We already fill in some defaults for this to work in a local environment.
    - `POSTGRES_HOST`: db
    - `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`: You can fill in whatever
      you like with these or just leave it with default value, since it only affects
      your local dev environment. But please keep it consistent since if you lose it,
      you will lose access to your local database and will need to re-create it.
  - `TOKEN`: Your bot token created in previous step
- The `config.json` needs to be filled in with the config needed to run the commands:
  - `prefix` is needed for the bot to trigger a command.

### Install node dependency

```bash
npm install
```

### Build and run docker container

```bash
# On the root folder of the project RUN
docker-compose up bot
# OR
docker-compose up -d bot # to run the container in the background (detach mode)
```

---

## Notes on working with the repo

### How to run commands inside the container

On most UNIX-like systems (macOS, Linux and WSL), you can just use the `container-exec.sh` bash script:

```bash
# multiline command - interactive mode - allow us to run multiple command
./container_scripts/container-exec.sh

# or just run a specific command
./container_scripts/container-exec.sh npm run test # run `npm run test` inside the container
```

If you can't or don't want to use `./container-exec.sh` wrapper script then you can run it manually:

- `docker-compose <service-name> command`

```bash
docker-compose exec discord_bot_dev npm run test
# same as ./container-exec.sh npm run test
```

```bash
# Run interactive mode, multiple command
docker exec -it discord_bot_dev bash
# same as ./container-exec.sh
```

- To run a command intereractively with a command prompt inside the
  container, run this comand: `docker-compose <service-name> bash`

- The service name is defined within the [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml) file.
