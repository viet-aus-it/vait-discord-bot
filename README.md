## Onboarding

### Creating your discord app and bot

You will need to manually create a new discord application and a new bot. Please check out [Create a Bot Application](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot)
and [Adding a bot to your servers](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html) for more details.

While creating the bot, please note down the bot `TOKEN`

On the application page, go to the General Information and note down the `PUBLIC KEY`

Click Oauth2 from the left panel, and note down your `CLIENT ID`

Once you have invited the bot to your server, open Discord, go to Settings > Advanced and enable developer mode.
Then, right-click on the server title and select "Copy ID" to get the `GUILD ID`.

Please make sure you have these information before proceeding to the next step.


### Creating the config files

#### Using the onboarding script

On most UNIX-like systems (macOS, Linux and WSL), you should be able to run the
onboarding script. This script will create a local dev environment file, install
dependencies, build the docker containers and set up a pre-commit git hook.

```shell
./scripts/onboarding.sh
```

Please ensure that you have all the required programs/executable are
installed on your machine before running the script. If somehow the script
does not work for you, please let us know via the Issue tab or ping us on
Discord, and you might need to follow through the manual process.

#### Manually

After creating your discord app and bot, create config file and fill in the values you get from the previous step

```bash
cp .env.dist .env
```

- The `.env` file needs to be filled in with these values:
  - Discord configs:
    - `TOKEN`: Your bot token created in previous step
    - `GUILD_ID`: The guild ID that you want to use your bot with to test out commands
    - `PUBLIC_KEY`: Your bot public key.
    - `CLIENT_ID`: The client ID of your bot
  - DB Values: We already fill in some defaults for this to work in a local environment.
    - `POSTGRES_HOST`: localhost
    - `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`: You can fill in whatever
      you like with these or just leave it with default value, since it only affects
      your local dev environment. But please keep it consistent since if you lose it,
      you will lose access to your local database and will need to re-create it.

**Note:** **DO NOT** commit the `.env` file to Git.

### Build and run the service locally

Run these commands at the root of the project

```bash
docker compose up -d db

pnpm install
pnpm deploy:command
pnpm start
```

---

## Useful commands

### DB migration & Client Generation

```bash
pnpm prisma:migrate
pnpm prisma:gen
```

### DB GUI

```bash
pnpm prisma:studio
```

### Deploying your commands to a test Discord Server

- Please make sure you have filled out your `GUILD_ID`, `TOKEN` and `CLIENT_ID`
  in the `.env` file.
- Add your commands into the `src/command/index.ts` file like so.

```typescript
import yourCommand from './yourCommand';

export const commandList: Command[] = [yourCommand];
```
- Run the `deploy:command` command.

```bash
pnpm deploy:command
```

- **IMPORTANT:** You should only deploy your commands **ONCE ONLY** after
there is a change in command registration (adding a new command, editing
options of an existing one). Running this too many times in a short period
of time will cause Discord API to **lock your bot out**.


### Troubleshooting:

- When deploy slash commands, if you got `Error: Cannot deploy commands`,
it's normally because of your bot doesn't have permission to do so. You
need to authorize your bot with scope: `bot` and `applications.commands`
using `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=$CLIENT_ID&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands`

- Another reason might be because the bot authorisation failed. Please open the previously generated `.env` file
and make sure your credentials are correct.

- If a bot cannot read the messages content, check the [Discord Developer Portal => Bot Section](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
and see under `Privileged Gateway Intents => Message Content Intent` feature is enabled. This should be enabled.

### Running lints and tests

```bash
pnpm format
pnpm test
```

## Testing staging/production build

- Copy out an env file for the stage you're testing. Use `.env.staging` for staging, and `.env.production` for production.
- Build the staging/production stage image.
- Start the service to test.
- For the `.env.[stage]` file, instead of `localhost`, put in `db` as the `POSTGRES_HOST`.

```bash
# Replace the `[stage]` with either `production` or `staging`
cp .env.dist .env.[stage]
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.[stage].yml build bot
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.[stage].yml up db bot
```
