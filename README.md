## Onboarding

### Creating your discord app and bot

You will need to manually create a new discord application and a new bot. Please check out[this guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot) for more details

### Creating the config files

#### Using the onboarding script

For most UNIX-like users (macOS & Linux), you should be fine with running the
onboarding script. Please ensure that you have all of the required
programs/executable are installed on your machine before running the script.
If somehow the script does not work for you, please let us know via the Issue
tab or ping us on Discord, and you might need to follow through the manual
process.

```shell
./onboarding.sh
```

#### Manually

After creating your discord app and bot, create config file and fill in the values you get from the previous step

```bash
cd discord-bot/
cp .env.dist .env
cp .env.docker.dist .env.docker
```

- The `.env` can be ignored for now.
- The `.env.docker` file needs to be filled in with these values:
  - `DB_HOST`: db
  - `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB`: You can fill in whatever you like with these or just leave it with default value,
    since it only affects your local dev environment. But please keep it
    consistent since if you lose it, you will lose access to your local
    database and will need to re-create it.
  - `TOKEN`: Your bot token created in previous step

### Install node dependency

```bash
cd discord-bot/
yarn install
```

### Build and run docker container

```bash
# On the root folder of the project RUN
docker-compose up
# OR
docker composer up -d # to run the container in the background (detach mode)
```

***

## Notes on working with the repo

### How to run commands inside the container

For macOS and `Debian/Linux/WSL` users, you can just use the `discord-bot/container-exec.sh` bash script:

```bash
# multiline command - interactive mode - allow us to run multiple command
./container-exec.sh

# or just run a specific command
./container-exec.sh yarn test # run yarn install inside the container
```

If you can't or don't want to use `./container-exec.sh` wrapper script then you can run it manually:

- `docker-compose <service-name> command`

```bash
docker-compose exec discord_bot_dev yarn test
# same as ./container-exec.sh yarn test
```

```bash
# Run interactive mode, multiple command
docker exec -it discord_bot_dev bash
# same as ./container-exec.sh
```

- To run a command intereractively with a command prompt inside the
  container, run this comand: `docker-compose <service-name> bash`

- The service name is defined within the [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml) file.
